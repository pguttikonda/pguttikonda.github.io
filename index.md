### At Kenss Solutions, we believe that technology should be an asset for all businesses - not just corporate behemoths with hundreds or thousands of employees and multi-million dollar budgets.

Our mission is to provide technology and product direction to small and medium size businesses - the same level of technology knowledge and sophistication that large enterprises employ to develop and deliver best-of-breed systems, without the expense of a large tech team.

Our team is led by experienced tech leaders that have each spent the last 20 years designing, building and supporting ecommerce technology - consumer facing websites, product life-cycle management, inventory and supply chain management systems, order management and fulfillment, reverse logistics, warehouse management systems, email and marketing solutions, customer relationship management (CRM), connecting and integrating with third-party tools & APIs, to name a few. This is the technology that multi-billion dollar companies use to run their day-to-day operations. 

The challenges associated with building these kinds of solutions are more or less the same, but each business or supplier is dependent on technical help that either doesn't have the same level of experience and expertise or is too expensive. Our goal is to provide an alternative to that - real experience that gets things done right in a timely and economical manner.

Whether you need help in building proprietary in-house technology to manage your business, systems to automate operational processes,  better integrate with various e-commerce portals like Amazon, Overstock, eBay, etc, or you are looking to gain valuable insights from your data - whatever your technology needs, we are available to help you succeed!
